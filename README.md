This is a To-Do Android app made with flutter, a cross platform development platofrm created by google.
This To-Do facilitates the users to create tasks through an alert dialog which gets opened when
the add button in the corner is pressed. user is prompted to enter the task name and subsequent save adds
the task to home screen. users can check the box against the task if it is completed and then delete them.

One important technical thing added to this app is Hive,a local storage unit. Through which the task data 
can be stored in the device's memory and be able to load it whenever the app is opened.
